DESCRIPTION                                             *ZendTools-description*

A simple set of useful functions for working in PHP with Zend.

===============================================================================
USAGE                                                         *ZendTools-usage*

PrependClassRequireOnce()                           *PrependClassRequireOnce()*

Inserts a `require_once` directive for the class under the cursor that is named
according to Zend conventions. Zend naming involves prepending a
pseudo-namespace to the name of each class which also reveals the path to its
source file (e.g. `Company_Tools_InflectionHelper` should map to
`Company/Tools/InflectionHelper.php`).

Move the cursor to a class and run `<leader>zo` (**z**end + require_**o**nce) 
or `ZendTools#PrependClassRequireOnce()`. For example, running it for the class
symbol on the following line:

 $helper = new Company_Tools_InflectionHelper();

Would result in:

 require_once 'Company/Tools/InflectionHelper.php';
 $helper = new Company_Tools_InflectionHelper();
